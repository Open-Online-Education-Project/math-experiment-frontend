# Front End Prototyping for Math Experiment

Prototype for OOEP. 

Ahmed :heart: created crazy awesome designs for us that we can access at [https://invis.io/FY10EA6DPCND](https://invis.io/FY10EA6DPCND). Note the button on the bottom right where we can export CSS elements to speed up our prototyping.

_Goal:_ Complete pages 5, 7, and 10 by March 11th.

Note: Meeting with Michael + team at 1 PM ET Saturday.

Meeting with Michael: 
All pages (currently two) should be a new html page. Just a mock-up, so use static content right now. Note: While we are making our elements, make notes of the content that we need from the backend.

Step 1: Common elements (i.e. some frame for all content to be put inside):
- blue box on grey box
- navigation bar (this is overlapping div)
- Top bit of the website.

Step 2: Content:
- Syllabus: titles then bullet lists.
- Section materials: a box with content (psets/lectures/etc.) in one big box.
  - Michael will give us some stuff.

Step 3: Modal for the pdf popup.
(Find something that doesnâ€™t require jquery/react)
Make an x to dismiss it rather than clicking outside the modal.

Typography: Uncertain
Border-left is some css option
